## 👋 Data Science Concepts/Tools 2025 @ Constructor University Master "Data Science for Society and Business"

🙋‍♀️
This *GitHub organization* is the practice area for the modules **Data Science Concepts** and **Data Science Tools**.   

🔖 **BOOKMARK** THIS PAGE! You will need it often.

⏩ **All students in MDSSB (onsite) and MDSSBO (online) must become members of this GitHub organization!** (See below. 👇)

Onsite (MDSSB) and online (MDSSBO) students are in different Master programs and therefore in different modules. However, the modules are very similar and share the same practice area here.

Another difference is the *mode of teaching*.


**For ONSITE students:**  
You learn week by week in the classroom on campus. However, there is an option for remote participation for late arriving students.  
All coordinates are on the course website:  
[**Syllabus and Schedule Website**](https://cu-f25-mdssb-01-concepts-tools.github.io/Website/)  
Read the syllabus and schedule in full to get more information. 

**For ONLINE students:**   
You learn week by week in a mostly asynchronous self-paced and self-timed way. There is a weekly touch point with a tutor, but little direct contact with the instructors.   
Look for the Course "Data Science Concepts" on [learn.constructor.university](https://learn.constructor.university).


👩‍💻 
The main purpose of the organization is to provide **personalized repositories** for registered students for **Homework Projects** and the **Final Project**. You have to become a member. 
Your repos are private and only you and the instructors can see them. Not even your fellow students can see them. 


### Become a member of the organization ⭐ (mandatory for all students in MDSSB and MDSSBO)

Steps to onboard you 👣 

1. **You** sign up for a GitHub account at https://github.com/signup, it's free. Read https://happygitwithr.com/github-acct for selecting your GitHub name. When you already have a GitHub account, you can use this. Consider signing up for GitHub Education, it can give you a free GitHub Copilot subscription. 
2. **You** enter your GitHub User Account Name in this [Form](https://forms.office.com/e/jqNDNTN5xP) (The form is accessible with your Constructor University Credentials, only users related to the courses will be accepted.)
**Deadline: As soon as possible (so NOW 😀🏃🏾‍➡️)**. *If you fill the form later your on-boarding will be delayed.* It is important because after this step the instructors have to invite you
3. **Instructors** will invite you to this GitHub organization. (You have to wait until this is done! We also try to do it as soon as possible.)
4. **You** have to accept the invitation! Two ways: 1. You receive an email with the invitation (Check the Email address you used to register! Check Spam Folder!). 2. You go back to this very page (maybe reload). Sign in to GitHub with your account. You should then see that you were invited. 
5. Now, you can access all repositories that will be created from your practice in this organization! These may come step by step as the course progresses.
